# Menu2Me
Mobile Application

## Description:
The intention of this application is to enable people to order food directly from their chosen restaurant within a food court. 
The mission is to have the user be able to order from a menu and the order gets sent to the kitchen of the chosen restaurant. 
The user pays online and nominates a seating area to have the order delivered to.
We find that the importance of this application will be to minimise queuing at food courts and allow adequate social distancing to take place.

The user can scroll through and select each item for purchase and place into shopping cart <i>yet to be developed</i>.  The user can also choose to select more specific information such as nutritional information to be displayed for each item placed in the shopping cart.
